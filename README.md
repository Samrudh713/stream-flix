Introduction

"StreamFlix" is a dynamic movie search website that I developed using React.js and JavaScript. This project integrates seamlessly with the OMDB API, allowing users to explore and discover their favorite movies effortlessly. Leveraging React's state management and useEffect hooks, the application fetches movie data asynchronously, ensuring optimal performance and user experience. With a responsive UI and thoughtful design, StreamFlix delivers a visually appealing and intuitive platform for users to search for movies, view detailed information, and enjoy an immersive browsing experience. This project showcases my skills in frontend development, API integration and my ability to create engaging and functional web applications.
